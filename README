Welcome to the TWalErgo project!

The aim is to create a flawless keyboard.

The file "Keyboard" is the design I am currently hacking.
The file "Keyboard_rev2" is a less older version
The file "Keyboard_rev1" is a very old version I wanted to keep.

The file "Keyboard_left.svg" is the keyboard shape I am currently hacking (left hand only).
